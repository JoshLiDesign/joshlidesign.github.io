He said we are too poor to afford education. That just struck me as the cruelest irony - to tell 5-year-olds that, through no fault of your own, born in the wrong place at the wrong time, 'You will not get educated.'" - John Wood, founder of NGO Room to Read.</h1>

	<h1 class = "overviewtext2" style = "top: 80px">Southeast Asia has been a hub of immense economic growth over the past few years. This has led to tremendendous improvements in living conditions and social benefits, lifting millions out of poverty and pushing the new generation for higher levels of education. In every member state in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, literacy rates have consistently reached above 75%. The GDP per capita has also, correspondingly, increased over $1400 USD in under 20 years. This serves to show the intricate link between poverty and education. A characterization of this would be people living in poverty who leave school for work, which deprives them of the necessary literacy and numeracy skills they need to further their careers. Their children, in turn, are trapped in a similar situation years later, with little income and few options but also to leave school and work. <br></br>Although the result of a concerted effort to improve education over a decade and a half has certain broken many southeast asians out of this cycle, many challenges still face this growing society. For one, the backlashes that comes with rapid urbanization and financial globalization could be seen in the inequality of development in different regions - with rural areas being disproportionally affected. For instance, Indonesia and the Philippines had a population of 17% under the line of extreme poverty in 2005, many of whom belong in marginalized groups. This has gradually dropped to 7% over the decade, but the pursuit of UN sustainable goals, especially No Poverty and Quality Education, should bring that number even lower.</h1>
