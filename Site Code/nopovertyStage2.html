	<h1 class = "imgtext2" style = "font-size: 18px">and her four children make their home beneath a bridge in Mumbai. Aruna makes under a dollar a day selling flower garlands, barely enough to cover sanitation costs. Her husband could earn at most $10 a week. The children works from 6 to 10 on weekdays and longer on weekends to try to bring food on their plates, because some days they go without breakfast or dinner. At night, Nadya stays awake for fear of drunks doing harm to her. Nadya and her family lives in constant fear of displacement, confiscation and unemployment.</h1>
