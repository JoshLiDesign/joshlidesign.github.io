	<h1 class = "overviewtext2" style = "top: 80px">The eradication of poverty in all its forms remains one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Despite the immense progress we have made in lifting people out of extreme poverty, too many around the world are still struggling for the most basic human needs. <br></br>UN reports that more than 3 billion people - nearly 1/2 of the worlds of population - live on less than $2.50 a day. These people suffer from regular shortages of food, clean drinking water and sanitation. While economic growth in developing countries such as China and India has faced rapid economic growth, progress has largely been uneven among social classes. In particular, women are likely to receive less paid work, education and own less property. In other regions such as South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where 80% of the those in extreme poverty live, progress has also been very limited. Not to mention that new threats brought on by climate change, conflict and food insecurity, mean even more work is needed to bring people out of poverty.<br></br>The SDGs are a bold commitment to end poverty in all forms and dimensions by 2030. This means taking responsibility to target the most vulnerable, increase basic resources and services, and support communities affected by conflict and climate-related disasters. And it takes all of us to achieve it.</h1>
