	<h1 class = "imgtext2" style = "font-size: 18px">Nelson Ochola is 15 and in 8th grade, the last year of primary school. His dream is to be a pilot who flies all across the world. He has only been to school under a tree, where, if it rained, classes were canceled. Because of food shortages in the area, Nelson could not afford to eat lunch on most days. It makes him difficult to concentrate on his lessons in the afternoon, and he noticed the same for his teachers.</h1>

	<h1 class = "overviewtext" style = "font-size: 54px">Overview</h1>
	<h1 class = "overviewtext2" style = "top: 80px">Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrolment rate in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half. Dramatic increase in literacy rates also led to more girls are in school than ever before.<br></br>However, successes has also been rare in some developing regions due to high levels of poverty, armed conflicts and other emergencies. In Western Asia and North Africa, ongoing armed conflict has seen an increase in the number of children out of school - a worrying trend. While Sub-Saharan Africa made the greatest progress in primary school enrolment among all developing regions – from 52 percent in 1990, up to 78 percent in 2012 – large disparities still remain - whether that be economically or regionally. Children from the poorest households are up to four times more likely to be out of school than those of the wealthiest households. <br></br>Achieving inclusive and quality education for all reaffirms the belief that education is one of the most powerful and proven vehicles for sustainable development. This goal aims to provide equal access to affordable vocational training, to eliminate gender and wealth disparities, and achieve universal access to a quality higher education by 2030.</h1>
