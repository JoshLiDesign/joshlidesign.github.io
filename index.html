    <h2>Activity 1: UN Sustainability Goals Site</h2>
    <p>
      In this activity, I tied together the elements of HTML, CSS, and Javascipt to create flip-boxes on UN Sustainable Development Goals.
      Since this is my first experience in designing a website, it taught me the order in which I should organize my code for clear 
      presentation. Activity 1 also gave me an opportunity to test out the basics of coding - including CSS elements, classes, ids, divisions, 
      image implementation, and window size adaptation. Not to mention the implementation of title banners and the steps to fix an element onto the page. In addition to these indirect aspects of programming that I was taught, this activity directly allows to create flip-boxes, which is an essential part of my website.

    <h2>Activity 2: JSON Data - HIV Infeaction Rate By Country</h2>
    <p>
      In this activity, I learned how to access JSON files about HIV infection rates by country and display that using graphs. While extracting information is unnecessary for my site, the use of javascript in this activity is important. In sections that utilizes flip-cards or short points, maintaining a consistant spacial design is crucial. Since this activity calculates the width of the screen and bases the size of the bar graph on that, I could employ the same approach to distribute information and spaces evenly across the page. For instance, when the user changes the size of the window, instead of moving elements down, their proportional size would decrease but the overall design would remain the same.
